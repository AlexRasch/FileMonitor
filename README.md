# FileMonitor

FileMonitorPInvoke is a open-source C# application that makes use of the Windows API functions, like FindFirstChangeNotification, FindNextChangeNotification, and ReadDirectoryChangesW, to easily track file changes in a specified directory. It allows you to monitor file additions, deletions, and modifications in a straightforward way. The project is licensed under the permissive MIT License, allowing everyone to freely use, modify, and include the code in their projects, as long as they credit the original author. Happy file monitoring!


## Inspiration

The application is loosely based on the example from Microsoft's documentation [Obtaining Directory Change Notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/obtaining-directory-change-notifications), providing a reliable and simplified solution for file monitoring.
